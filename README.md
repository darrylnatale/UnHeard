UNHEARD

UnHeard is a web application for music lovers and DJs that is intended to make it easier for users to find little-known or obscure songs by their favourite artists â€“ bootlegs, demos, rare 12" versions or remixes, etc. 

HOW IT WORKS

The app finds, sorts and analyzes a given artist's entire catalog of music, and then compiles a complete listing of their songs. 

After compiling a full list of songs, it compares the results with content available on streaming platforms such as Spotify, and returns only those tracks that are NOT available for streaming, 

It then searches YouTube for these tracks, and returns embedded videos for those that are found.
